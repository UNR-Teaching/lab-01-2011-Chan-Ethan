I know from previous experience that > is piping so it feeds the result from "ls" into "newfile.txt" (it creates said file if need be, which is the change in what "ls" returns after this command)

The "git add" command basically makes pending changes to the repo (which you push with "git commit") (also these are the changes you see when you run "git status")

It says that "newfile.txt" is a change needing to be committed which just means you should push it to make the edit on the github servers

The "git diff" command shows changes, like what you would see in the changelog of a standard repo
